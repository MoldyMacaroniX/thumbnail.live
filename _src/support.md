# Help Center

Welcome to the Thumbnail.live Help Center. If you need any help, we'll be happy to assist you.

Thumbnail.live is a tool to preview your YouTube thumbnails and comments before you post them. Unlike other tools, Thumbnail.live also lets you customize your branding and gives you more than one option to upload thumbnail and avatar images.

If what you need help with isn't here, feel free to [contact us](/support/contact/).
