# About Thumbnail.live

Thumbnail.live was crafted from the ground up to be the best YouTube thumbnail preview tool. Test your thumbnails live to see how they'll look before you even upload your video.

## Why we made this

It is common for YouTubers to want to see how their thumbnail and title will look before uploading it to YouTube. That is why we created Thumbnail.live.

We display your thumbnail, title, avatar, and username in a way similar to how YouTube shows it in order to give you an idea for how your video will look on YouTube.

## Thumbnail.live is a free resource for all

Thumbnail.live is run out of pure passion and does not make any profit. It is just a free resource for all. No strings attached.
