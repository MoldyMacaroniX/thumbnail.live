# Search Preview Help

For help with providing information and updating the thumbnail preview, [read this guide](/support/thumbnail/).

The [search thumbnail preview](/search/) shows how your YouTube thumbnail and title will look when the user searches for it.

If you are on a phone where it is hard to see the thumbnail preview, rotate your device 90 degrees to see the whole preview.
