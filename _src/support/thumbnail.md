# Preview Thumbnail Help

## Update the thumbnail preview

The thumbnail preview should automatically update upon editing an input field. If it doesn't, you can press the **Preview Thumbnail** button to update it with the most recent input fields.

## Switch between using uploaded thumbnail and thumbnail link

If you want to use an uploaded thumbnail instead of a thumbnail link, make sure the **Thumbnail URL** field is empty. You will know its empty when it says **https://example.com/file.png** in dim text.

If you want to use a thumbnail link instead of an uploaded thumbnail, just paste your link in the **Thumbnail URL** field and it will take priority over any uploaded thumbnails.

## Switch between using uploaded avatar and avatar link

If you want to use an uploaded avatar instead of an avatar link, make sure the **Avatar URL** field is empty. You will know its empty when it says **https://example.com/file.png** in dim text.

If you want to use an avatar link instead of an uploaded avatar, just paste your link in the **Avatar URL** field and it will take priority over any uploaded avatars.

## Saving your inputs

All inputs, except for uploaded files, are saved whenever the thumbnail preview updates. This means they will automatically load in when you visit the page in the future.

This does not occur for uploaded files, however. If you want to retain your thumbnail and avatar, we recommend using links instead.

## Clear saved inputs

You can clear your saved inputs by clearing the localStorage on our website via your browser.
